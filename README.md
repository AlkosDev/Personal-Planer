# Personal Planer

This site was created to better arrange and plan your days.

It was made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap 5 as it's CSS framework.

Icons and favicon was made by Icons8.

Abilities of the planer:
- Create events and Delete events
- Set time start, time end, colour, date and title for the events
- Display events in the current week
- Marks events in the current time
- Display all events in the current week

I'm also planning to make electron app of this site and mobile support. Stay tuned.
